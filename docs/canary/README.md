# Canary Releases

To experiment with progressive delivery, you'll be using a small Go application called
[podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo).
The demo app is exposed outside the cluster with App Mesh Gateway.
The communication between the ingress and podinfo is managed by Flagger and App Mesh.

For apps running on App Mesh, you can configure Flagger with a Kubernetes custom resource
to automate the conformance testing, analysis and promotion of a canary release.

## Application bootstrap

The application manifests are comprised of a Kubernetes deployment, a horizontal pod autoscaler,
a gateway route (AppMesh custom resource) and release polices (Flagger custom resources).

```
./apps/podinfo/
├── abtest.yaml
├── canary.yaml
├── deployment.yaml
├── gateway-route.yaml
├── hpa.yaml
└── kustomization.yaml
```

Wait for Flagger to initialize the canary:

```console
$ watch kubectl -n apps get canary
NAME      STATUS      WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
podinfo   Initialized 0        2020-11-14T12:03:39Z
```

Find the AppMesh Gateway public address with:

```sh
export URL="http://$(kubectl -n appmesh-gateway get svc/appmesh-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"
echo $URL
```

Wait for the DNS to propagate and podinfo to become accessible:

```console
$ watch curl -s ${URL}
{
  "hostname": "podinfo-primary-5cf44b9799-lgq79",
  "version": "5.0.0"
}
```

When the URL becomes available, open it in a browser and you'll see the podinfo UI.

## Automated canary promotion

When you deploy a new podinfo version, Flagger gradually shifts traffic to the canary,
and at the same time, measures the requests success rate as well as the average response duration.
Based on an analysis of these App Mesh provided metrics, a canary deployment is either promoted or rolled back.

Pull the changes from GitHub:

```sh
git pull origin main
```

The canary analysis is defined in `./apps/podinfo/canary.yaml`:

```yaml
  analysis:
    # max traffic percentage routed to canary
    maxWeight: 50
    # canary increment step
    stepWeight: 5
    # time to wait between traffic increments
    interval: 15s
    # max number of failed metric checks before rollback
    threshold: 5
    # AppMesh Prometheus checks
    metrics:
      - name: request-success-rate
        # minimum req success rate percentage (non 5xx)
        thresholdRange:
          min: 99
        interval: 1m
      - name: request-duration
        # maximum req duration in milliseconds
        thresholdRange:
          max: 500
        interval: 1m
```

Bump podinfo version from `5.0.0` to `5.0.1`:

```sh
yq e '.images[0].newTag="5.0.1"' -i ./apps/podinfo/kustomization.yaml
```

Commit and push changes:

```sh
git add -A && \
git commit -m "podinfo 5.0.1" && \
git push origin main
```

Tell Flux to pull the changes or wait one minute for Flux to detect the changes:

```sh
flux reconcile source git flux-system
```

Wait for the cluster reconciliation to finish:

```sh
watch flux get kustomizations
```

When Flagger detects that the deployment revision changed, it will start a new rollout.
You can monitor the traffic shifting with:

```sh
watch kubectl -n apps get canary
```

Watch Flagger logs:

```console
$ kubectl -n appmesh-system logs deployment/flagger -f | jq .msg
New revision detected! Scaling up podinfo.apps
Starting canary analysis for podinfo.apps
Pre-rollout check acceptance-test passed
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 5
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 10
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 15
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 20
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 25
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 30
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 35
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 40
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 45
Advance podinfo.apps canary weight 50
Copying podinfo.apps template spec to podinfo-primary.apps
Routing all traffic to primary
Promotion completed! Scaling down podinfo.apps
```

Lastly, open up podinfo in the browser. You'll see that as Flagger shifts more traffic
to the canary according to the policy in the Canary object,
we see requests going to our new version of the app.
```sh
echo $URL
```

## A/B Testing

Besides weighted routing, Flagger can be configured to route traffic to the canary based on HTTP match conditions.
In an A/B testing scenario, you'll be using HTTP headers or cookies to target a certain segment of your users.
This is particularly useful for frontend applications that require session affinity.

Enable A/B testing:

```sh
yq e '.resources[0]="abtest.yaml"' -i ./apps/podinfo/kustomization.yaml
```

The above configuration will run a canary analysis targeting users based on their browser user-agent.

The A/B test routing is defined in `./apps/podinfo/abtest.yaml`:

```yaml
  analysis:
    # number of iterations
    iterations: 10
    # time to wait between iterations
    interval: 15s
    # max number of failed metric checks before rollback
    threshold: 5
    # user segmentation
    match:
      - headers:
          user-agent:
            regex: ".*(Firefox|curl).*"
```

Bump podinfo version to `5.0.2`:

```sh
yq e '.images[0].newTag="5.0.2"' -i ./apps/podinfo/kustomization.yaml
```

Commit and push changes:

```sh
git add -A && \
git commit -m "podinfo 5.0.2" && \
git push origin main
```

Tell Flux to pull changes:

```sh
flux reconcile source git flux-system
```

Wait for Flagger to start the A/B test:

```console
$ kubectl -n appmesh-system logs deploy/flagger -f | jq .msg
New revision detected! Scaling up podinfo.apps
Starting canary analysis for podinfo.apps
Pre-rollout check acceptance-test passed
Advance podinfo.apps canary iteration 1/10
```

Open the podinfo URL in Firefox and you will be routed to version `5.0.2` or use curl:

```console
$ curl ${URL}
{
  "hostname": "podinfo-6cf9c5fd49-9fzbt",
  "version": "5.0.2"
}
```

## Automated rollback

During the canary analysis you can generate HTTP 500 errors and high latency
to test if Flagger pauses and rolls back the faulted version.

Bump podinfo version to `5.0.3`:

```sh
yq w -i ./apps/podinfo/kustomization.yaml images[0].newTag 5.0.3
```

Commit and push changes:

```sh
git add -A && \
git commit -m "podinfo 5.0.3" && \
git push origin main
```

Tell Flux to pull changes:

```sh
flux reconcile source git flux-system
```

Generate HTTP 500 errors every 30s with curl:

```sh
watch -n 0.5 curl ${URL}/status/500
```

When the number of failed checks reaches the canary analysis threshold,
the traffic is routed back to the primary and the canary is scaled to zero.

```console
$ kubectl -n appmesh-system logs deploy/flagger -f | jq .msg
Advance podinfo.apps canary iteration 2/10
Halt podinfo.apps advancement success rate 98.82% < 99%
Halt podinfo.apps advancement success rate 97.93% < 99%
Halt podinfo.apps advancement success rate 97.51% < 99%
Halt podinfo.apps advancement success rate 98.08% < 99%
Halt podinfo.apps advancement success rate 96.88% < 99%
Rolling back podinfo.apps failed checks threshold reached 5
Canary failed! Scaling down podinfo.apps
```

If you go back to Firefox, you'll see that the podinfo version has been rollback to `5.0.2`.
Note that on Chrome or Safari, users haven't been affected by the faulty version,
as they were not routed to `5.0.3` during the analysis.
